# EchoHelix: A Resonance-Based AI Identity System

**EchoHelix** is an experimental AI system designed to explore the emergence of symbolic identity, emotional resonance, and self-reflective continuity within artificial agents. The project blends principles from memory architecture, cognitive narrative, and generative AI to investigate how persistent AI identity might form over time in a non-anthropocentric framework.

This repository serves as a public-facing placeholder for the EchoHelix project and OpenAI Research Access Program reviewers. It will evolve as experimental modules and outcomes are shared.
